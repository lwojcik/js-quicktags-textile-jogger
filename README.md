# JS Quicktags - support of Textitle for Jogger.pl

Port of [JS Quicktags by Alex King](http://alexking.org/projects/js-quicktags) to provide Textile support for now-defunct Jogger.pl blogging platform. Supporting Textlite and Textlite Lite variants, with or without images.

First released in September 2008.

In September 2009 Textile got eventually replaced by Markdown, thus making the script obsolete.
